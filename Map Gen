This is the final version of Map Generator 2 by Punt.

This is hands down the most powerful map making tool out there period. It takes Dragon to a whole new level, by using 2 BMP image files for painting the raw map prior to rendering them into a usable Map file.

The first image you paint utilizes the entire 96 colors of the pallet index for pure land tiles, where Dragon must share with Altitude. This allows for a the most complete range of land tiles you can ask for (or as close as possible).

The second image is then initially generated by Map Generator to give you the basic matching image, and you can then use the second pallet index to paint your altitudes.

Combined, this tool using both images can render a map with extreme details right out of the gate, reducing the need to spend hundreds of hours cleaning up areas or adding further detail in a map editor like CentrED, the way Dragon would leave you.

This is again, the original version, unmodified or tossed around the internet.
