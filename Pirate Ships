    Got this error I remember this script from years ago I don't think it is actully drag and drop I think there was a few edits that had to go with it.

    Code:

    + Custom Systems/Piratesandship/ShipsPirateCaptian.cs:

    nope that is untrue it is drag and drop

    you need to go look at the script on line 121 you will see what it is calling if I am right that is the npc pirate its calling

    no edits was ever needed for this system to work

    This never worked well spawning from a spawner (will not respawn or some other issues can't remeber). The ship only moves if a PM is in LOS, and the sinking portion is cool but I would like to see the ability to commandeer the ship ( killing a dude doesn't sink a ship), perhaps have the key to the ship drop on the pirate captain. UO has badly needed this addition like old ultimas brigands, orcs, pirates, but they need to be more realistic, they should try to board your vessel or bring ship to shore and fight PM's on the land. (this was how a poor avatar acquired a ship in the original games) The pirates should also have an Opposition Group something like Pirates oppose Sea Creatures. Krakens like to destroy ships all sea going creatures would be hostile to any ships.
    Just a suggestion since this novelty has been resurrected several times with very little improvement or additions.

    Well technically it hasn't been improved several times...lol. The original author, Haazen, was German and his script was in German; (From My Original Thread: http://www.runuo.com/community/threads/pirates-their-back-enjoy-runuo-2-0-callador2ks-ml-svn.100407/)

    I just want everyone to keep in mind that the official Broadsword, formally EA, commercial Ultima Online servers have been borrowing ideas and code from this community for years, marketing them, and re-releasing updated, newer versions, of them with their new expansions; this script is no exception to that rule. Check out the High Seas expansion and tell me you don't notice the similarities. UO had nothing remotely like that before this script was posted on RunUO; that said, yes this script can be improved, and until I get around to it you all are welcome to try your hand in doing so ;)

    So looking at it what needs to change:
    [x] LOS?! - Well the pirates were never meant to sail the seas on their own as they do on EA/OSI/Broadsword. I didn't edit them this way because, at the time, I didn't have the know-how to do so. I do like the idea and maybe this will be a future update.
    [x] Taking over a pirate ship?! - I think the code to do so is actually in the scripts, but for some reason the system never worked so instead I just made things to when you kill the pirate captain the boat sinks. I may change this and I may not. It depends on my skill level.
    [x] The Opposition Groups?! - I really like this idea and it's so easy to do; there is an Opposition.cs somewhere in your Scripts/ folder. Add a new entry.
    [x] Ship Boarding?! - This also can be done with a little editing. Remember the PirateCaptain.cs spawns his crew. You can have the crew spawn both on the PM boat as well as on the pirate ship to simulate this; I didn't have the skill at the time to implement this.

    For the most part there is a common theme with the above... my skill level. I didn't write the script. I hacked and slashed (aka Frankensteined) the script. What I did was make it work for RunUO 2.0 and the Ultima Gold Client; it was then reposted, by me, in 2010. Right now to make changes to this script will take me a while; I'm caught up with other projects. Nothing I post is closed source though, all scripts created to work with the current server repositories on the internet are, by default, under the GNU GPL Version 2.0 (because they are all derivatives of the original RunUO 1.0 SVN). That means this community is more than welcome to obtain, edit, and make changes to those scripts, at no charge to you, despite what some of the developers would have you think. If developers say otherwise then they are in violation of the license agreement.

    I'm more than willing to help, but as I stated above, I have a certain skill level and I'm not sure where it places me yet. I have confidence in my work, but I am no coding genius by any means. I run into difficulties quite a bit which requires endless hours of research; most people just don't have the time and I'm no exception to that either. All of this being what it is, if you have C# knowledge and you'd like to help me get these changes done then I'll be more than happy to code the changes for you guys :)

    As of late I've forgotten which scripts are involved anyway. I have to make heads and tails out of the stuff I uploaded before I can begin anything. lol

    The also have used building ideas and custom art. I just wish they would take some decorating advice from us. Their maps are unfinished and boring! TerMur has the potential to be a really cool map. If they would finish the map work and do more deco.

    I was messing around with a chasing pirate ship the other day (not sure if it was this one, or from RunUO) and they did board my ship. If they come alongside one of the 'pirate crew' teleports to the ship. Not usre how many would teleport as I moved away ha ha. fun fight though. And the sinking is pretty cool too.

    Is this the one where they chase and the ship sinks when they die? That is cool and all but they leave no loot and it can be a pain to kill them, all risk, no reward?

    if that's the case I'd suggest a floating chest where the ship went down.

    This got a little tricky! But it's all working fine. I would not say it's "Drag n' Drop" ready, so don't just toss it in and expect it to play nice!

If at first you don't win... THAT IS WHY GOOGLE WAS MADE!

    that floating chest thing is a good idea think the guy who did this is going to update it for highseas and stuff soon but kinda one of those things that really needs to wait till all the high seas boats are working and that might be awhile still

    OK, This is the problem file. I just can not get it to work. really like the pirate ship, and the pirates attack but I had to take the captain out to get it to compile
    Error:
    " cs0246: Line !21: The type or namespace name 'Pirate' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)"
     



    You might try this one. I just realized I am using a completely different package (I got mine form an 'Invasion system" pack). I am using the 'chasing pirate' folder. It was just drag & drop for me... good luck :)

    The captain spawns helpers (other pirates). you need a pirate script its trying to spawn a mobile named 'Pirate'

    In the ShipsPiratesCaptain.cs on line 121 change both instaces of Pirate to ShipsPirate and it will compile just fine.
