I've applied the z-level fix, converted methods to use linq where available, and converted for statements to foreach loops where necessary.

I also removed all of the 1.0 code and took region out of the props menu (which made the system crash the shard easily).

Oh, I also converted many set's to private set's to help optimize, and also converted many public functions into private ones for optimization.

Take care :)

    I posted an update to this, as I cleaned up the rest of the system that I didn't notice last night.

    I dont have stone just flag. ofcourse i dont create region area, i been at the moment creating area. Its empty. But this is strange for me because if you work with region control and you got it 999999+ players online and save comming and in this time you try to set up region its comming crash. No solution for that ?

    If you do not create at least one initial region, it will crash because the region entries are null. At least, this had always been the one flaw with the system. I am not certain this is the problem now, because I have not used this in a long time since its been updated.. But I would guess it is still the same flaw.

    You must create a region. It can not be empty.

    Dian thank you for replay. I know also this problem from few years ago. But nobody can do something with that? maybe add to standard areas something like this area with XYZ 1, 1, 0 to 2, 2, 0 ? maybe this help with this problem ? how you think so ?

    Yes, that is what I remember having discussed as a solution as well.. It does seem like the best way to solve the problem, and I thought someone did. But, if this was your crash problem,, I guess it is safe to say that it was not solved yet ;)

    Was this the crash you had?

    Seems there should be a 5x5 square tile region by default though, just to solve it.

    K been messing with this a lil while today just testing it out all seemed fine I set the flag setregionControl.jpg
    Props'd it
    then I set the region box marked in red

    setRegionbox.jpg
    the boundary seems to work ran around the outside moving closer & farther away to make the you are now under the protection of the town guard then you are no longer under the protection of the guard

    then when I get to the zone marked in green which is where the flag is right in the middle I get
    you are under the protection of the town guard /your not under the protection of the town guard
    over & over


    the only things I can think of is that there is a large static structure in the middle? & region box is set at 0 plain
    Or I did not Props something in the options?

    any help with the cause would be great seems to work otherwise

    in one corner you can try to build it really high tower then set the bounds from top tower to ground on second corner. Because when you set up for example from one corner on the ground to another corner on the ground you got it for example Z with value 1. Try this solution for me works great

    Freaking awesome. If only it contained a "allow pvp" attribute it would be completely perfect. Maybe some day I'll figure out how to add that. lol
