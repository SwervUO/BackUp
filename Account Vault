Account Vaults are a shared chest between all characters on your account. This allows you to safely transfer goods between characters without having to hide them somewhere, or drop them into a house.

    The command to summon your account vault only works in town.
    Account vault will show up for 20 seconds before it disappears.
    You can only use the command once every five minutes.


Usage

[accountvault (while in town, as stated above)

    Account Vaults - Safely transfer goods between characters on the same account!

        I have also included a cleanup system that deletes empty account vaults every four hours....

    Oh wow, that is just excellent!

    I had the idea to make Bank box's accessible between any character on the same account, but this is a terrific idea too!

    I think I saw this at work on Imperium about two years ago. Maybe not the same code, but something similar.
    It's awesome and beats having to drop items on the ground in an immediate logout area.

    Tresdni updated Account Vaults with a new update entry:

    No need for cleanup timer at all.

        Vorspire pointed out a blatant fact to me this morning, smh. I've updated this system to just delete the empty box after the hide timer, instead of running a non-stop timer checking every box in the world.

        Efficiency ftw.

    I test this scripts (on justuo publish 3) by use command and put couple of items in the box but next I still received information that "you can only summon your vault once every 5 minuts". I awaiting 20 minuts, reloging between character on account and problem still exist. Same on two another accounts.

    Are this DataTime lines in AccountVaultCommand.cs correct ?

        if (acctv != null)
        {
        if (DateTime.UtcNow + TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5.0) > DateTime.UtcNow)
        {
        from.SendMessage("You may only summon your account vault once every five minutes.");
        return;
        }

        acctv.Z = toZ;
        acctv.X = toX;
        acctv.Y = toY;
        acctv.Map = @from.Map;
        acctv.Visible = true;
        acctv.DisplayTo(@from);
        acctv.DoContainerHideTimer(acctv);
        acctv.LastSummoned = DateTime.UtcNow;
        }

    That statement would always be true. I think he meant to have it:

    Code:

     if(acctv.LastSummoned + TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5.0) > DateTime.UtcNow)

    Solved. I changed line like you wrote

        if (DateTime.UtcNow + TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5.0) > DateTime.UtcNow)

    to

        if (acctv.LastSummoned + TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5.0) > DateTime.UtcNow)

    and now everything works correct.
    Nice addon :)
    Many thanks for your post Ravenwolfe !
