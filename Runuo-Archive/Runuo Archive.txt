Im a total noob and was all over the web looking for script resources this was the only thing I really found that had a bunch of custom content many work on Justuo publish 3 but some need updating im hoping someone smarter than me will want to browse it and maybe work on some, and that guys like me who are total noobs can find it as helpful as me in getting there world running. This is a Runuo Archive file I found it has custom systems, quests, items,magic all that really awesome resource. Hope someone finds it useful!!!!
