    That is so cool. Do you make candles with it or just honey? I use to love growing plants but the every day having to log on and water and add potions really wore my interest down. Do the bees have to be cared for every day? I am sure you can change how long in the scripts but was just curious since I am not a scripter :) Oh BTW my real name means Honey Bee so I love bees. :)
    So I will be making sure Dian grabs this one

    Thats the challenge for me, too.. for releasing my scripts. Nearly everything I create is tied into my custom map or other systems that I have, that are not standard.. Its hard to get myself to create two versions.. just to release one. :-/

    Definitely going to have a look at this though, good stuff man :)

    understand that dian hehe why I started to do readmes with just the edits because my playermobile and bsecreature and baseai scripts have nothing but tons of custom stuff. but I hope you enjoy this system Dian if you have the bounty system in this can be used with the ranching system I think the ranch system will go great with your custom shards so players can raise animals

        Seems like those are just warnings, not going to for certain cause trouble, but is saying there are some code areas that do need attention and cleaned up

        again says no errors something is not right your getting warnings I never seen before too... what is this about mono support..

        run your server run debug mode see if that can help some you have warnings from other scripts not just cooking but I cleaned some of those up.

        Our server works with these warnings (other than cooking) without problem. But when I implement Cooking Expansion I cannot compile it.

        Please try to be more specific when you are posting troubles. When you just say it will not compile, there is nothing for us to go by to try and help you with.

        Explain how you are adding something, and the errors you get with doing so, and we can try to help :)

        Dian. Unfortunately under my mono - I cannot compile both
        - the latest "clean" version of justuo and
        - my server + additional scripts
        and this expansion :(.
        We cannot full run up our server with expansion in debug version because the server does not start at all (pasted earlier logs). On the other hand, use the debug option when starting the server does not display any additional information besides those already pasted. I think that the problem may be due to possible incompatibility of certain elements of the package with mono (or be caused - after all - one of the warnings) or some implementation lack because without expansion, our server works properly.

        Here is our implementation list step by step. Dragon, mayby You can see any our implementation mistake ? I'm really confused and havnt any idea whats wrong is it:( Sorry for problems.

        First I drop full expansion to my scripts/custom folder
        next
        for Cooking Expansion:
        I turn off all this files in scripts/items/food : Asian.cs beverage.cs beverageempty.cs cookablefoods.cs cooking.cs foods.cs fruits.cs Vegetables.cs bowls.cs
        Also turn off fireplace addons in my items/addons folder: GrayBrickFireplaceEastAddon.cs, GrayBrickFireplaceSouthAddon.cs, SandstoneFireplaceEastAddon.cs, SandstoneFireplaceSouthAddon.cs,
        StoneFireplaceEastAddon.cs, StoneFireplaceSouthAddon.cs and all files in farming folder. Also I turn off files SBbeekeeper.cs, CandleLong.cs, CandleShort.cs, CandleSkull.cs and defcooking.cs .

        Next in basecreature.cs i change

            public enum MeatType
            {
            Ribs,
            Bird,
            LambLeg
            }

        to

            public enum MeatType
            {
            Ribs,
            Bird,
            LambLeg,
            Venison,
            Chicken,
            Duck,
            Turkey
            }
            Click to expand...

        and from

            if (meat != 0)
            {
            if (MeatType == MeatType.Ribs)
            {
            corpse.AddCarvedItem(new RawRibs(meat), from);
            }
            else if (MeatType == MeatType.Bird)
            {
            corpse.AddCarvedItem(new RawBird(meat), from);
            }
            else if (MeatType == MeatType.LambLeg)
            {
            corpse.AddCarvedItem(new RawLambLeg(meat), from);
            }

            from.SendLocalizedMessage(500467); // You carve some meat, which remains on the corpse.
            }
            Click to expand...

        to

            if (meat != 0)
            {
            if (MeatType == MeatType.Ribs)
            {
            corpse.AddCarvedItem(new RawRibs(meat), from);
            }
            else if (MeatType == MeatType.Bird)
            {
            corpse.AddCarvedItem(new RawBird(meat), from);
            }
            else if (MeatType == MeatType.LambLeg)
            {
            corpse.AddCarvedItem(new RawLambLeg(meat), from);
            }
            else if (MeatType == MeatType.Venison)
            {
            corpse.AddCarvedItem(new RawVenisonSteak(meat), from);
            }
            else if (MeatType == MeatType.Chicken)
            {
            corpse.AddCarvedItem(new RawChicken(meat), from);
            }
            else if (MeatType == MeatType.Duck)
            {
            corpse.AddCarvedItem(new RawDuck(meat), from);
            }
            else if (MeatType == MeatType.Turkey)
            {
            corpse.AddCarvedItem(new RawTurkey(meat), from);
            }

            from.SendLocalizedMessage(500467); // You carve some meat, which remains on the corpse.
            }
            Click to expand...

        Next, I modify craftitem.cs where after line " private bool m_NeedMill;" I add this

        Dragon Slayer updated Cooking Expansion Set with a new update entry:

        Update 7.0

            Version 7.0
            Fixed all the warnings but maybe one or two.
            Cleaned up DefCooking some more.
            Moved ContainerFood.cs to be with Food.cs as it is a base

            I am going to release this because I cleaned up some scripts.

        Read the rest of this update entry...

        Wow Fenris.. I really do not know what to say there. I have pretty much zero experience with Mono or any idea what the conflicts are between Mono and Windows with the Net Framework. However, I would almost agree that maybe there is something in Mono that will not allow compilation with Warnings.

        Does anyone know if there is a setting for the Compiler in Mono to allow or disallow compiling through Warnings? Maybe similar to using the Unsafe Code setting for compiling the Server?

        Fenris, have you ever had warnings prevent you from compiling any other scripts? Or is this the first time you had this problem that you know of..?

        You not using JustUO your running Runuo. Almost every script posted here has been converted to work with JustUO Only.. my hole system is based on JustUO.


        I say you need to convert your shard over to JustUO if you want current support and better scripts :) as the Dev Team of JustUO is the best of the best :)

        Sareus the problem with the two, RunUO and JustUO that you have here, is the Quest systems are coded in different ways. So yeah, you would either need to convert the quest area of the cooking system here for the RunUO Quest system, or like Dragon said.. consider converting to JustUO.

        Just a warning though, if you are thinking of converting to JustuO (or even ServUO for that matter)..

        The Base files of about everything from Mobiles to Items and in between have enough differences in the serializations that you will almost certainly need to start your converted shard from a scratch stand point. Meaning, if you have a developed world with players.. as much as I hate to say it, you will almost certainly need to start the world from the beginning again, as your world saves will not really be compatible.
        I can say though, it would be well worth it in the end, as JustUO is very much more further along in content than RunUO will more than likely ever be.. not to mention much more active with the community in growth.

        I spend a couple weeks trying to convert my saved world files from my original RunUO to ServUO last year before we created JustUO.. and every dtep forward created 5 more steps backwards. I had to give up and just start clean. But it was well worth it in the end :)

        Thanks or update Dragon Slayer. With ver 7 modifications our server compiles correctly :) As I understood the old versions of the animals from the game saves need to be removed during startup (example cows, bulls etc) ? The server indicating that they can not be loaded after expansion implementation and turn off justuo version of animal files (I think the reason for the message are differences in the serialization between the justuo and your version of files)

        Thanks Dragon Slayer and once again sorry for my inquiry. As I see Mono still hides many of surprises for me, and as you can see even some warnings may be of considerable importance here :p
        About my saves - I think to:
        - remove individual types of animals through the use of in-game command or
        - clean or shutdown all spawns (without removed because I got many of additional custom spawns / created ingame/on my world)
        + world save
        and then applying the prepared save on the server with your extension.
        If I remember I once saw a guide on how to do with certain animal remove command on runuo forum. Do you have mayby any personal experience in this regard?

        Oh I'm aware of the ramifications of my decision :Banghead:. But as you stated RunUO has kind of died off in terms of development which just wont do in the long run. :Writing:

        Fenris if you have your world spawned with XML Spawner, use the command [xmlfind and you can search for specific spawners with a certain creature type. You can then select all those spawners and run a reset command on all of those spawners to turn them off.

        You could alternativley use a command like [global set DoReset true where xmlspawner and it will despawn and turn off ALL xml spawners in the world for you to reboot with your script package.
        Afterwards, use the command [glabla set running true where xmlspawner to turn them all back on again :)

        Don't know why but on my client version 7.0.38 I can cut (with dagger or butcher knife) for example one cow, bull, pig, deer or greatheart corpse many times for hides and meat (dropped inside animal corpse loot gump). In addition meat cut with an animal got a house walls graphics (??) but as I see in Your scripts for different types of meat ID codes are correct.

        BaseSweet should be in the file Scripts\Items\Special\Holiday\HolidayFood.cs ?

        You may be needing using Server.Items; at the top of the file possibly?

        As someone who has never really liked the toothache attribute I simply commented BaseSweet out of the Playermobile.cs; along with changing the Types of (DarkChocolate, MilkChocolate, WhiteChocolate) from BaseSweet to Food. Everything works fine and no more annoying ToothAches.

        I realize this fix isn't for everyone but its made me feel better so if anyone wants a more detailed explanation Ill post the steps.

        I posted here because I downloaded JustUO and dropped your package in with the readme edits and it threw that error *shrugs* Just assumed it was something that got missed. After not being able to get it to work I just removed the toothache feature all togeather. As for the sickness I actually like that concept thats one of the main reasons I got this pack.

        Great Work by the way loving it! :Thumbsup:

        Thanks for your new update. Graphics are already correct but player can still cut (with dagger or butcher knife) for example one cow, bull, pig, deer or greatheart corpse more than one times for hides and meat (dropped inside animal corpse loot gump) although the message is displayed "you see nothing useful to carve for the corpse". Normally, after cutting once - another cutting does not bring resources.

        I believe Dragon said there was somewhere in the files, a setting to how heavy the animals reproduce.

        you really shouldn't have to worry about it tho LOL I have had my server running for a month with this system and long as there is timberwolfs and a sever restart should be no problem

        server restart if I remember correctly babies get wiped and if there is timber wolfs in the area the will kill the babies I know its horrible lol but life is a circle and we need to keep the pop under control..


        but again I have ran my server for a month or longer with this system and my npc number still the same it goes up about couple hundred then drops again. all because those timberwolfs keep the pop under control by killing npcs.. also the babies only can be born if the spawner the mom spawns on is not at its max.. say spawn 5 sheep well its all maxed out s no sheep will have babies untell one of those 5 die so your safe no overloading your world I promise and I use the kill command all the time on them im not sure what your doing different lol...

        Also you don't need to change those settings you can do this in the nopc its self

        MateActive = true;
        LitterSize = 1;
        MaxAge = 30;
        MatingSeason = Seasons.Any;

        Here list seasons that can be set

        if ((map.Season == 0) && (MatingSeason == Seasons.Spring)) returntrue;
        if ((map.Season == 1) && (MatingSeason == Seasons.Summer)) returntrue;
        if ((map.Season == 2) && (MatingSeason == Seasons.Autumn)) returntrue;
        if ((map.Season == 3) && (MatingSeason == Seasons.Winter)) returntrue;

        I will be changing the mobiles to only make babies in there season right now set to any lol

        basicly you can set the season it has a babie I was looking more into the script when the animal hits its max age it will die... so like I said system pretty much controls its self

        also I noticed the boar didn't have a littersize and that was causing her to pop unlimited babies out this has been fixed I set the max to 2 babies for each animal :) you can change this on your mobiles if you wish. ill even have a guide how to make more animals act like the ones the ones come with this package so people can make there own custom ones.

        I think that my problem is compared with shorter hind/great harts activity (twilight - is short part from the rest od the day). As I see when this animal resting they got a gray colour and cannot being attacked by other animals (they are invisible for players and other animals). Also GM cannot kill them via [kill command (I received information that "They cannot be harmed"). But on our staff toons we see hunderts of it as invisible/resting especially on small land areas (example islands) When we click on it his status change to visible/forced. I think that longer activity (example change part of day activity from twiling to the day or changing twilight/day hours for longer nights) can solve this problem (looks that timberwolfs got a full day activity). Now we will change our shard day/night hours for longer twilight with smaller babies increase (3)
        No less - I can confidently say that your system is brilliant :D

        Day and night is just for sleeping...

        So if they are asleep you wont beable to kill them as a gm are invul and invisible just wait for them to be awake or double click them that forces them to be your pet..

        like I said they can only mate during there seasons and I looked all them was set to any season so they would make any season to help control babies even more. just set the season you want them to mate in like I have went though and changed a lot of them for next update so they will only mate now during there season.. if am correct JustUO winter is only during winter so mating will only happen during winter ;) for some of them and spring and fall for others.

            also the babies only can be born if the spawner the mom spawns on is not at its max.. say spawn 5 sheep well its all maxed out s no sheep will have babies untell one of those 5 die so your safe no overloading your world I promise and I use the kill command all the time on them im not sure what your doing different lol

        Are you sure? My hind, wolfs and example cats still got many on babies - much more than max spawn in area (example 100+ hind on one screenshot :)). I think that spawns control only limit of hind created by individual spawner but no babies ..... So yes - all work correctly until animal created by individual spawn do not have babies which born out of spawn, because these babies are beyond the control of that spawn and can reproduce in a manner not covered by the spawner limit restrictions. I see no other explanation, by a dramatically increase the population from several of hind on the small area to even 300-400 in two mayby three week :D Also look that if you remove spawner with animal mom or remove this mom by click on spawner npc decrease amount button, her babies still exist in game and later can repoduce.
        I think that most accurate approach would be to limit the number of animal babies and simultaneously reduce the time of their lives for example, so that the deer do not reproduce too quickly in relation to population loss. This is the effective solution, because it is not possible to place spawn of wolves next to each spawn of deer/hind, especially that his babies havn't any area limit and can move everywhere.

        To limit the growth of new young hind, according to your suggestion I introduced season different from the one in which deer are born. BTW one question about season change. If I remember good - in ServUO/RunuUO I can change it only manually in mapdefinitions.cs. It's possible to enable season autochange in JustUO?

        Mayby Dragon. I detect this problem especially on small area for example islands like Gloow and Haven. On our shard Trammel isn't available for a players except Haven. Around this City xmlspawner create packs of animals and here I find hundreds of hinds. Also I found many of wolfs on the South part of Gloow island especially around Zoo. I think That small land area on islands block animals long way movement so they meet much often and often born babies (on continents this problem isn't visible due large land area). May you check this two islands on your shard (and animals population on it) please? Sorry for my questions but I looking how to solved this problem on my shard which works - as you wrote- on mono:). BTW on both location I found that hinds or wolfs babies havnt information about his mom in props (null).

        Thanks for your script Ravenwolfe. It's very useful addon but unfortunately remember season only to next server reset. Also as I see for a winter season snow is visible on the ground only in 2D version, but no in Enhanced Client :(

        Btw I find another season change addon on runuo - here is a link:
        http://www.runuo.com/community/threads/runuo-2-0-rc1-time-system-with-season-change.74070/
        with link to latest verson at the end of topic.
        I do not test it yet but a put link here for those interested in this kind of addition.

        Yeah, sorry, i very rarely restart so it works fine for me.

        If I restarted often, i would just modify the mapdefinition as needed and not need the script at all, lol.

        I use to use that time system years ago. It worked well, but yes it was not truly perfected. However, it really does add some nice touch's to the shard, including the activation of all light source items in the world that light up and turn off according to day/night (like lamp posts around the towns and windows in buildings)

        I was just reading it was bugged reason I said that hehe...

        I am working on a new way for animals to create babies at a random chance of prego

        be like if chance is 10 then the baby will be born if not then it wont have a baby in real life not every time it maets it has a baby so I figured I would addd it so it would slow baby birth down some on shards that cant handle the baby boom lol.. but im going to login to his shard see if we can come to a fix.... also im going to add sme more wolfs into the package that will only kill for food to help control the pop.

        1 turn off in game while logged in somehow?
        2 take the scripts out of the folder all together?

        I dont wanna ass:Drool:sume the wrong thing & waste time

        this is gonna be an awesome challenge as is

        Honestly.. I wouldnt use this system as is.
        Anyone that grabs this system should review what it has in it carefully, and just take the portions you want to incorporate into your shard package in piece form.

        The guy that posted this is no longer present here to support anything, and it also was just a hodge podge of multiple other peoples work that he combined into one package. So take care using it as it is.

        Oh, and I believe what he meant by 'Turn Off' was, you need to remove the scripts, as there are ones in the package that would replace them.

        Actually I've got it compiling fine on the EC distro. Make sure you read the documentation folder and make all of the edits in the "installation instructions" files.

            First you will need to turn off all this files in your scripts/items/food
            Asian.cs beverage.cs beverageempty.cs cookablefoods.cs
            cooking.cs foods.cs fruits.cs Vegetables.cs bowls.cs

            You will also need to turn off all the fireplace addons in you items/addons folder
            GrayBrickFireplaceEastAddon.cs, GrayBrickFireplaceSouthAddon.cs, SandstoneFireplaceEastAddon.cs, SandstoneFireplaceSouthAddon.cs,
            StoneFireplaceEastAddon.cs, StoneFireplaceSouthAddon.cs

        sorry I need time to look at all the edits

        just for reference this is the original version, I believe harvest system is in justuo repo
        http://www.runuo.com/community/threads/cooking-harvest-and-more-package.89072/

        & i can compare the old to DragonSlayers version which has updated code

        but just wasnt wasting time on that until i do more searching

            Actually I've got it compiling fine on the EC distro. Make sure you read the documentation folder and make all of the edits in the "installation instructions" files.

        Its not that it doesn't work its just a bunch of systems thrown together and its kind of a hot mess as is.

        I've been using and updating it since he released v7 and i like pieces of it but i've been cutting most of the extra out.

    Nice work! My players love it. Had to change the ranchstone.cs due to someone placing it and double clicking it without adding an owner with [props.


    Code:

    public override void OnDoubleClick( Mobile from )
            {
                if (!(from.HasGump( typeof( RanchStoneGump))))
                {
                    if(this.Owner == null || this.Name == null)
                    {
                        from.SendMessage("Please props the stone and set an owner first!");
                        return;
                    }
                    if (from == m_Owner || from.AccessLevel >= AccessLevel.GameMaster)
                    {
                        from.SendGump( new RanchStoneGump(this) );
                    }
                    else from.SendMessage("You aren't the ranch owner.");
                }
            }
