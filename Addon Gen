I cleaned up the system a good bit.

    Removed redundant "using" namespaces.
    Used linq where possible.
    Better deed naming! Instead of "TableSaw", it will say "a table saw deed".
    Use of "an" instead of "a" prefix, if the first letter is a vowel.
    Generates to directory "AddonGenerator" by default now, instead of "TheBox".

    Tresdni submitted a new resource:

    Arya's Addon Generator - Updated - Better 4.0 code, cleaner code, and better deed naming.
