This is just like any skill ball really, except it's smarter. It automatically adds skills based on which expansion you are running.

I put in extra protection that others don't have:

    It won't let you use it unless it's in your backpack.
    It won't let you open the gump, and then move it out of your backpack.
    Deletes after use.
    Easy to find how many choices it gives you, and what to set the skills at (default: 7 skills at 100.0.)
    Easy to comment out skills it includes, and it won't leave gaps in the gump.

Enjoy :)

    Nice, I've always wondered why no one does these with an expansion check!
