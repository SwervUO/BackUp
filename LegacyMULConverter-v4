Here is the LegacyMULConverter-v4 program in case anyone needs it. It's command line based. I wrote 2 batch files 1) to extract UOP files to MUL files, and 2) to convert MUL files to UOP files. That way I just put the files I want to work with into the "temp" folder that I created under the program folder and then click on the batch file I want to use. The program will look in the folder you specify and use any MUL or UOP files it finds and then process them how you tell it via parameters. It's pretty easy to setup and use, just look at the readme.txt file it explains it all.

This is not my software but I offer it in the original RAR file with no content changes what so ever.

    That's because you don't double click the EXE file to run it, and if you READ the "readme" file it clearly states:

    Extracting all UOP files in a directory:
    LegacyMULCL.exe -x <path>
    Repacking all MUL files in a directory:
    LegacyMULCL.exe <path>
    Opening the syntax instructions:
    LegacyMULCL.exe /?

    you need to open a DOS window, and then type whatever one of the 3 options above you wish to accomplish. you need to enter a command and/or path location after the EXE. You can either type the command each time you wish to use the program, or you can create a .BAT (batch file) containing the command line parameters and path so that you just need to run the .BAT file to have the program run properly.

    Hi Carl,
    I'm having some trouble with this and not sure why
    I can open the command prompt under Admin and everything but when I enter: LegacyMULCL.exe -x C:\Program Files(and the rest of it) I get this: Directory 'C:\Program' does not exist!

    I tried this just to be sure: LegacyMULCL.exe -x <C:\Program Files> and of course I get this: The syntax of the command is incorrect.

    So, I'm lost.
