I've included 79 server birth rares for you to use or expand upon.

Do not spawn these! Just place one in your area of choosing!

    These do not decay, they stay not movable until someone finds it and picks it up...just like a true server birth rare would.


    Displays "Server Birth Rare" in it's context, so that players know what it is. You can take this out if you want in BaseServerBirthRare.

I made it pretty easy to find them all for adding, each item begins with ServerBirth, so just search in-game via [add, and you'll see the full list.

It's pretty easy to expand on this, but I figured you'd enjoy the one's I've created already :)

    I really enjoy your system it's clean and simple.

    I was working on an update to this version by Erica (< RunUO Forums Link). If people are still interested I'll release my edited version But Id urge you to use this system instead.
