     This is the most used Dragon version, Dragon Mod+

    Dragon allows a map maker to paint a map on a BMP image using PaintShop, PhotoShop, or other popular paint programs that support specific pallets, and render the image into a usable map with static files.

    Dragon is very flexible and customizable as to editing the color pallet to your own land tiles or altitudes, as well as what world items it should place during the map rendering. (like trees, grass's, and other worldly decorative items)

    This version is the original. If you have ever downloaded a version of this from another site, you can never be certain it was not modified by other people first. This one, I assure you is the clean original version.

    This is the Original Dragon Mod 10.

    For anyone familiar with Dragon tools, the mod 10 offers an updated color pallet and an extended set of transitions to go with them. (If I remember correctly) I will eventually compare these to make myself more familiar with what the changed between these really were.

    Again, this is the Original version, unmodified from any other source. This has not changed hands unknown times before being posted here :)

    This Mod was created for the most part by HellRazor, and with any luck he will eventually come around and offer some information about some of the more important changes he had made.

    And again, like the others, this is an Unmodified Original version that has not been changed in any way by unknown sources.

    This is the Updated Dragon 1.0362 with my Imod13 add-on included.

    My Imod13 add-on offers 9 new terrain types not previously offered in any of the other Dragon Mods. If you wish to see full details on what this offers you can visit my site and check the Imod13 Addon link. I figured I would offer it here for free to anyone looking to create their own map and have the most options when it comes to terrain types. Enjoy

    No it wasn't developed that far back. I completed it in 2007 if I remember correctly. I just started using Dragon in 2005 and upgraded it with my Imod9+ in 2006... ah I digress.

    LOL. well while that is definitely a problem, its not caused by Dragon. You still have the DIF files in your Ultima Online directory. The DIF files are only needed when your using the original Britannia world that comes with the game. When you use a custom map you need to either delete the DIF files for the Map0 and Map1 worlds, or move them into a backup folder so the game doesn't see them and load them into the client.

    Here is a list of the DIF files you will need to delete or move to a backup folder.

    If you are using a custom Map0 replacement world then you will delete or remove these files from your Ultima Online folder

    Stadifl0.mul
    Stadifi0.mul
    Stadif0.mul
    Mapdifl0.mul
    Mapdif0.mul

    If you are using a custom Map1 replacement world then you will delete or remove these files from your Ultima Online folder

    Stadifl1.mul
    Stadifi1.mul
    Stadif1.mul
    Mapdifl1.mul
    Mapdif1.mul

    Once those files are deleted or removed from your Ultima Online folder, your problem will be solved. EA Games when they bought out OSI started adding in patches to the maps via DIF files that only update certain locations on the original game map, so what you are seeing is those certain areas of your custom map are be updated with the patch information from the DIF files.

    Also, in misc/MapDefinitions.cs you should set TileMatrixPatch.Enabled = false;

    This disables the MapDif reading of the Server.

    You really dont want to use the Mul2Bmp program to generate a map image for any usable image for map making.. It was never really refined to create a bmp image good enough to turn around and use again with Dragon, without a LOT of reworking the colors. It will (or did) create a fair image of the map0.mul file, but there will be a huge portion of the map that will have void colors because of the 3 way transitions on the map#.mul file.. and not having any specific color to assign those.

    Also, depending on the version of Mul2Bmp and the map#.mul file used, that could be the issue in itself. I am uncertain is it will even read a map of the current size of 7168x4096 where it was created when maps were 6144x4096.

    What errors are you having specifically?

    You will not be able to use the Dragon_m2b.exe (MAP2BMP) program with a my IMod13 version of Dragon. That's because the color table has been updated as have the scripts and the Dragon_m2b.exe is expecting the original Dragon color table and scripts. You can do this with the original unmodified version of Dragon but not the addon modified versions.

    I actually found your site before this one Carl, and wanted to tell you that the release of your modded version of Dragon is probably in my top 10 internet respect earners. It is refreshing to see in this day and age! I'm a new member, as of today, here but I think this one upload on your part is going to be enough to keep me around for a long time.

    +1 Respect Carl!

    Hi, i was just wondering if there where any ressources out there to learn about map making, tips and tricks, how exactly to use photoshop efficiently to build a map, the steps to take when making a map to make sure there are as little bugs as possible and make it look natural. Also a tutorial to explain the basics of using dragon. I'm actually using the lastest stable version of Sphere for the server. I'm planning to play with 5-10 friends that played this game with me 15 years ago. Who know, maybe if i can get this server up and running and in a few months if the gameplay is as i like it might become a real thing. But yeah, tutorials written or in videos would be greatly appreciated.

    ps; (I'm not a newbie at PS, been using it for a few years for university but i'm not pro)

    Hi Promethor
    There are some over on Ryandor.com yes. I have been behind in my work here, to migrate them to this site and update them. But they will be here soon, posted.
    In the mean tome though..

    http://www.ryandor.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=151

    Between this link above (Sorry images are not there, I need to retrieve them on the ryandor server still) and the pdf below, you should get a general idea. Keep in mind some of this is dated 10 years, but most is still very valid for just starting out with Dragon map making tool.

    I will try to get some more current material posted here asap.

    I have not used it, Im sure Carl Hamilton will know for certain, but there may not be one. You may need to create another group of the snow terrain, so you can compile your map without the tree statics being placed.

    Is there more than one group for snow on that pallet? I would need to dig out mine and go through it.

    The first entry is the color pallet group. So group number 07 in there is the first set of Snow.
    The entry 16 is SnowMeadow
    The entry 17 is Snow Forest..

    You can simply comment out one of those entries so one of those snow gorup colors do not generate any items. It will just generate the snow land tiles only.

    Or you can go further, and create your own item script for that snow group you want to change..

    Hey, jumping in a bit late but better than never right. ;)

    "glacier" is what your looking for, it allows you to make tundra or glacier areas that are just snow with no vegetation at all.

    // ****************************
    // 11 = glacier
    // ****************************
    d5 11
    d6 11
    d7 11
    d8 11
    d9 11

    // (11) Glacier
    d5 020 011a 011b 011c 011d
    d6 022 011a 011b 011c 011d
    d7 025 011a 011b 011c 011d
    d8 030 011a 011b 011c 011d
    d9 040 011a 011b 011c 011d

    You won't find a glacier.txt file because at the terrain level its exactly the same as snowmeadow.txt - the difference happens where color 11 doesn't get any item statics added to it so you just end up with the snow terrain and no item statics added to it.

    This is the Updated Dragon 1.0362 with my Imod9+ add-on included.

    I figured I would offer it here for free to anyone looking to edit one of my existing IMod9+ maps that may be floating around out there. If you are looking to make your own map I recommend using my IMod13 add-on which I release free earlier in this forum. Enjoy!

    Actually Dian you have every version of Dragon. Check your Darkshard DVD under Map Building Tools/Dragon... You have Dragon 1.0362 original with no mods. You have Dragon + Ryandor mod8,9,9+,10. You have my Dragon + Imod9+,10,11,12,13. Finally you have Dragon 1.0500 beta release (not 100% working 1.0362 is best), and Dragon2 (not 100% working 1.0362 is best). But you have them all :)

    Oh, I know I do :) Hackiem just mentioned having it if I wanted, I think he misunderstood the whole post and thread here, like I was looking for them or something.

    Is there a way to convert maps that were made back in "The old Days" to the new maps?

    Do you mean from the pre-ML size Fel/Tram to post-ML size?

    You can use the Map Copy functions of Fiddler to easily do so with .muls With Dragon I'm guessing you'd simply cut/paste .bmp versions from the old size onto the new size, and then generate them. Just make sure your color palettes are correct. Someone who knows Dragon better might be able to clarify or correct that though.

    Yes, there is a way. I have been using a program called "Map Extractor 1.6" it allows you to select your source map and what size (6144x4096), and then specify a destination map and what size (7168x4096), then you select "Copy Entire Map" and finally check the option "Copy Statics" then press the "START" button and wait a few minutes. It will read everything from the source Map and Statics and then create a new Map and Statics files with the new size selected and write everything into the new files. Everything will be in the exact same location as the original - just your dungeon space will now be larger giving more room to add new dungeons and areas. I'll post the "Map Extractor 1.6" here for anyone to download.

    The main difference between the different version of Dragon Mod's is new terrain types added as well as some of the scripts that generate coastlines etc... have been cleaned up so less touchup work is needed manually. There will still be some areas that will need manual touchups depending on how detailed you get with your BMP image. The more detail in the BMP (proper rounded corners and not choppy curves and corners) the less manual touchups will be needed to the generated map via an editor such as CentrED. To my knowledge my Dragon IMod13 offers the most terrain types and cleaned up scripts to date.

    Do any of the dragon mods support building maps that are 7168, 4096? I am playing around with maps with the old size (6144, 4096) and those maps work with client version 6. I can't get any of the old maps to work in the new client (7+) without the character going through floors, wrapping around the world improperly, or becoming completely stuck.

    No, there is not. You would create your map with Dragon and then use a map copy program to copy that map area into a map that is the correct size. That is how I got around that anyways. (I wanted the ML areas anyway)

    Carl Hamilton would know of other methods.
